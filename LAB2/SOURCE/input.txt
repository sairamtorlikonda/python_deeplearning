Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear
programming on both small and large scales.[27] In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.[28][29]

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,
imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[30]

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software[31] and has a
community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software
Foundation.
History

Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python
Main article: History of Python
Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[32] and its implementation began in December 1989[33] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica
(CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL)[34] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba
operating system.[7] Van Rossum remains Python's principal author. His continuing central role in Python's development is reflected in the title given to
him by the Python community: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) – a post from which he gave himself permanent vacation on July 12, 2018.[35]

On the origins of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996:[36]

...In December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be
closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking
about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent
mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).
